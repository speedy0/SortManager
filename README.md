This is a submission of a project for Sparta Global training. 

This project contains various sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Binary tree and many more.

The user is able to choose which algorithm should be run which then generates a random array with numbers between 0 and 1000.
The array will have length of 50 numbers.

Once the algorithm sorts the array, the time taken for such action will be provided. The user is also able to test all the algorithms in the program and compare time taken for each. 

The project contains also Logger using built-in Logger system with different level and message sorting system. Any Severe and Warning issues will be placed in issues foloder. Any informations that produce when programs finish running successfully will be saved in confirmation folder and any other messages will be placed in processes.

The project contains variety of tests using JUnit.
